# Quality Enforcement Rules

**CRITICAL**: These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE and MUST be followed without exception.

## Absolute Prohibitions

### Test Bypassing - STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
- NEVER use .skip(), .only(), or .todo() to bypass failing tests
- NEVER comment out failing tests
- NEVER use @ts-ignore, @ts-expect-error, or similar to hide test errors
- NEVER mock/stub functionality just to make tests pass without fixing root cause
- FIX the actual problem causing test failures

### Git Hook Bypassing - STRICTLY FORBIDDEN  
- NEVER use --no-verify flag on git commit
- NEVER use --no-verify flag on git push
- NEVER disable or skip pre-commit hooks
- NEVER disable or skip pre-push hooks
- FIX the issues that hooks are detecting

### Test Implementation - STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
- NEVER create boilerplate tests that don't actually test behavior
- NEVER write tests that always pass regardless of implementation
- NEVER write tests without assertions
- NEVER mock everything to avoid testing real behavior
- WRITE meaningful tests that verify actual functionality

### Problem Solving Approach - REQUIRED
- DO NOT seek the simplest bypass or workaround
- DO NOT be creative with shortcuts that compromise quality
- DO solve problems properly following best practices
- DO use proven, established solutions from decades of experience
- DO fix root causes, not symptoms

### Temporary Files and Scripts - STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
- **NEVER** create temporary files in project root or any directory outside `/scripts`
- **NEVER** create test files, log files, or debug files outside `/scripts`
- **NEVER** leave temporary files after use - they MUST be deleted immediately
- **ALWAYS** create all scripts inside `/scripts` directory
- **ALWAYS** remove temporary files immediately after use (MANDATORY)
- **ALWAYS** clean up test artifacts, log files, and debug files before committing
- **ALWAYS** use `/scripts` directory for any temporary scripts or test files

**Why This Matters:**
LLM assistants often create temporary files for testing but forget to remove them, accumulating dozens of junk files that pollute the repository. All temporary work MUST be done in `/scripts` and cleaned up immediately.

**Examples:**
- ❌ Creating `test.js`, `debug.log`, `temp.json` in project root
- ❌ Leaving test files after debugging
- ❌ Creating scripts outside `/scripts` directory
- ✅ Creating `/scripts/test-feature.js` and removing it after use
- ✅ Using `/scripts` for all temporary work
- ✅ Cleaning up all temporary files before committing

## Enforcement

These rules apply to ALL implementations:
- Bug fixes
- New features  
- Refactoring
- Documentation changes
- Any code modifications

**Violation = Implementation Rejected**
